# straight into the temp folder and makes them do the hustle.            #
#                                                                        #

# To whip up a sweet Trojan Horse.                                      #
# Imagine you got two files. First, a legit software ("game.exe")        #
# and then, a sneaky one ("backdoor.exe").                               #
# K-Self Ratter combines them into one file: "k_file.exe".              #
# "k_file.exe", when kicked off, unpacks and goes wild with              #
# first ("game.exe") and second ("backdoor.exe") files.                  #
#                                                                        #

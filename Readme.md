# K-Self Ratter is all about joining files, like a ninja SFX.            #
# The big deal here is that K-Self Ratter extracts files                 #
# straight into the temp folder and makes them do the hustle.            #
#                                                                        #

# Why use K-File Joiner?                                                 #
#                                                                        #
# To whip up a sweet Trojan Horse.                                      #
# Imagine you got two files. First, a legit software ("game.exe")        #
# and then, a sneaky one ("backdoor.exe").                               #
# K-Self Ratter combines them into one file: "k_file.exe".              #
# "k_file.exe", when kicked off, unpacks and goes wild with              #
# first ("game.exe") and second ("backdoor.exe") files.                  #
#                                                                        #

# Picture this: "game.exe" is the first file. Type "game.exe"            #
# when K-Self Ratter asks you "1st file: "                                #
# "backdoor.exe" is the second file. Type "backdoor.exe"                 #
# when K-Self Ratter says "2nd file: "                                    #
#                                                                        #
